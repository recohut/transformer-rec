        "To deal with sequential and session-based recommendation, many sequence learning algorithms previously applied in machine learning and NLP research have been explored for RecSys, based on k-Nearest Neighbors, Frequent Pattern Mining, Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more recently neural architectures using the Self-Attention Mechanism and the Transformer architectures.\n",

Transformer architectures in particular have facilitated building higher-capacity models and provided data augmentation and training techniques which demonstrably improve the effectiveness of sequential recommendation.\n",
